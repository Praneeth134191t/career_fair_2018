            <p class="center-item">The main aim of the school visits is to help the Advanced Level ICT students as well as Ordinary Level ICT students to prepare for their G.C.E. examinations. This is done by the faculty undergraduates with the conducting Lab Sessions, Revision Sessions and Theory Sessions depending on the request from the school children. With the number of volunteers from the faculty, individual attention is given to the ICT students to help them overcome any academic hurdle they face.</p>
            <p class="center-item">In addition to this, a Motivational Session targeted at all the Advanced Level students in general, increases the students focus towards passing their examinations and entering a University. The success of the entire event is measured by the numerous feedback that is received from the students.</p>
